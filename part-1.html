            Myanmar’s short-lived experiment with democracy ended when its top
            general, Min Aung Hlaing, seized power four years ago in a coup that
            ousted a civilian administration. The takeover sparked a brutal

            RFA recently spent 17 days in Kayah state, which sits along
            Myanmar’s eastern border with Thailand, to see how the twin efforts
            of prosecuting the war and building a new administrative state are
            progressing. During our time there, junta forces had renewed
            offensives to the north, as rebels scrambled to find dependable
            stores of ammunition and arms. New agencies created to serve
            displaced Kayah residents were also struggling with limited
            resources.

            wood fires in the brewing heat of the day for her customers who’ve
            come for her fried rice, dried pork and steaming garlic and onion

            The agreement was part of a larger series of democratic reforms
            rolled out nationwide, which paved the way for the historic 2015
            elections, in which Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy
            won a parliamentary majority.

            Today, for the most part, various factions in Kayah have set aside
            differences to form an alliance against the military regime, joined
            by pro-democracy militias whose fighters come from outside Kayah.
            The KNDF itself says it now has more than 8,000 members. More than
            400 have been killed in battle, one source said.

            Where once Karenni rebels dreamed of independence, now the goal is
            to build a federal system of government that can accommodate
            Myanmar’s ethnic groups but allow locals greater autonomy. This
            would be a first in a country that has been ruled centrally, and by
            the Bamar ethnicity, since its independence in 1948.

          <p>But the path there is steep.</p>

            While insurgents now control most of the state, the military holds
            the regional capital of Loikaw and scattered pockets of territory.
            The few paved roads remain disputed, increasing traffic on rough
            back roads originally built to ferry truckloads of teak and other
            timber to market. Residents say they saw little benefit from the
            trade, and controlling the resources around them is another
            motivation to fight.

            Battalion commanders say the military is now using new drones from

            make small gains in their push effort to retake an important supply
            road into Loikaw.

            When RFA visited, two local villages in southern Shan had to

            not, he said.

            The fighting and attacks from the air have pushed an estimated
            150,000 people from their homes into the hills of Kayah, where the
            forest canopies offer greater protection. Meeting the needs of these
            displaced communities is, besides the war itself, the biggest
            challenge facing rebel leaders.

          <p>
            Last year, Kayah leaders formed the Interim Executive Council to
            fill the administrative vacuum created by the junta’s retreat. There
            are departments overseeing home affairs, education, health, human
            rights and finance, among others.

            There are dozens of these camps in Demoso, most of which are buried
            in the dark hills surrounding the valley. Monsoon rains turn the
            dirt roads to a sucking mud and create a constant heavy pattern on
            the green plastic sheets. Shade offers the only relief from the hot
            sun of summer.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the Bangkok IDP camp in southern Shan, northwest of the busy
            maindrag from Demoso, Mu Bawu’s young son Francisco was quietly
            reading a book in the upstairs of their temporary home when the
            family heard a jet approaching this September.

            Just 12, he had talked about possibly becoming a doctor or a teacher
            when he grew up. But he wasn’t able to make it to safety before the
            bomb hit.

            “Whenever I hear the plane, my heart races, and I feel like I can’t
            live,” Mu Bawu, 44, told us. “I am not mindful of my body. I just
            feel overwhelmed and frightened.”
          </p>

          <p>
            When RFA visited the camp in November, two months after the attack,
            it looked as vulnerable as ever. It is close to food and water,
            however, so villagers are building new homes, bunkers first, beside
            the detritus of broken bamboo and torn clothes that remain from the
            strike.

            Near them, students learn in classrooms with thin walls that stop
            about two feet above the ground. The open space allows the kids to
            scramble down into surrounding trenches should they hear another
            plane approaching. They giggle through a practice exercise, but one
            resident told RFA that they are traumatized enough that the sound of
            a motorbike can send them scurrying for cover.

            Most of the IDPs come from targeted areas in the region, but Kayah

            Tint Za Hein is among the hundreds of new residents from
            Burmese-majority communities in Myanmar’s interior. Many have
            arrived in recent months, fleeing conscription the military imposed
            to replenish its diminishing ranks.
          </p>

          <p>
            With a tweed touring cap set snugly on his head, Tint Za Hein darts
            around on the same stretch of road on his motorbike checking on his
            various enterprises. There are several.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before the coup, Tint Za Hein’s love of research had led him to
            journalism and a job at the BBC. But after the elected civilian
            administration was ousted, he decided he wanted to participate in
            the resistance, not cover it.

            In Kayah, Tint Za Hein founded FederalFM, a radio station that
            broadcasts music and educational tips like what to do in an
            airstrike or how to apply first aid. The station also delivers news
            but it is careful to adhere to the revolutionary narrative.
            (FederalFM receives money from USAID. RFA also is funded by the U.S.
            government.)
          </p>

          <p>
            The information FederalFM reports “will be good for the community,”
            he said.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tint Za Hein also manages a non-profit that operates two barber
            shops, two tattoo shops, a beauty salon, a rice mill and a gas
            station. The money the businesses make “goes to the revolution.”
          </p>

          <p>
            His mother, he said, had once dreamed he would become a soldier, one
            of the few opportunities he said were available in the poor town
            near Mandalay in the center of the country where he grew up.
          </p>

          <p>
            “But I’m afraid of guns, so I don’t want to be a soldier,” he said.
            “I cannot do the fighting, so I do for the family. I do for the
            hospital. I do for the school and humanitarian (aid) and the media.”
          </p>

          <p>
            As he talks, a team of early 20-somethings mill around him,
            preparing a broadcast. They live and work from the same undisclosed
            location. If the junta knew where it was, they would bomb it.

            The day before video circulated of an 8-year-old girl who had been
            killed in a drone attack near Pekon, in southern Shan state. A man
            was also killed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Typically upbeat and energetic, Tint Za Hein said he had spent a
            night in tears, watching the useless effort to revive the young
            girl. It was a reminder that for all the activity and progress here,
            junta troops remain a lethal and indiscriminate threat.
          </p>

          <p>
            The resilience of Kayah residents is readily apparent too. But even
            as they put their heads down and try to make do, there’s no clear
            sign how it will all turn out or what’s left to endure.
          </p>

          <p>
            “It’s still dark,” Tint Za Hein said. “We cannot claim what will be
            tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow. We just live, day-by-day.”
