            relatively cosmopolitan Yangon, “Dr. Tracy” dreamed of becoming a
            great surgeon, a living testament to the possibilities offered in a
            new, freer Myanmar. The 2021 military coup dimmed her personal
            ambition, but not her hopes for democracy for her country.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tracy, 26, who asked to go by that name for security reasons, was
            among the young doctors and nurses that as members of the
            <a

            after it ousted an elected civilian administration in 2021. She’s
            now part of a smaller group who fled city centers in the country’s
            interior to move to border areas to assist rebels fighting the
            military.
          </p>

          <p>
            “This coup is not fair, simply,” Tracy said, from one of the huts
            that make up the O-1 hospital campus within Demoso township in Kayah
            state. “I asked myself, do you accept it? My answer was no. So, I
            resist, resist and resist.”

            Tracy has since completed her studies under a curriculum developed
            by an exile government made up in part by elected officials who
            managed to avoid arrest after the coup.

            But she doesn’t have the time or the resources to become the
            specialist she envisioned. It’s enough to help treat the cases of
            malaria and tuberculosis in the rural population she serves or help
            mend the shattered limbs of the rebels in her care.

          <h4>A taste of freedom</h4>
          <p>
            Tracy and her colleagues at O-1 grew up in a freer Myanmar than
            their parents had. A decade ago, military rulers seemed to set the
            country on a path of democratic reform. While Myanmar’s generals
            retained control of a number of seats in the Parliament and control
            over some of the country’s most important ministries, they agreed to
            share power with officials elected in a popular vote.
          </p>

          <p>
            After a half of a century of tight-fisted military rule, the changes
            brought a host of new opportunities for their generation and a taste
            of what could be, said Dr. Yori, 29, who is also from Yangon and is
            now the deputy medical superintendent of O-1.
          </p>

          <p>
            “We knew there were many things that we could achieve with our own
            civilization and our own people,” he said.

            The coup threatened all the progress, they believe. And when a young
            medical student was killed at one peaceful demonstration directly
            after the coup, thousands of health care professionals took to the
            streets and refused to work as part of the civil disobedience
            movement. Many were arrested by the military.
          </p>

          <p>
            In Yangon, Yori and Tracy were a couple (they’ve since wed) with a
            shared opposition to military rule. Fearing arrest, they both fled
            to Kayah after a few months. Yori’s initial intention was to join
            the People’s Defense Forces, militias that are fighting under the
            exiled National Unity Government.

            “I didn’t want to fight with a syringe. I wanted to fight with a
            gun,” he said. But he soon realized his skills as a doctor were
            needed more.

          <h4>Leaving a ‘privileged life’</h4>

          <p>
            O-1, like camps for internally displaced people it shares the hills
            of Kayah with, is a collection of corrugated steel, green tarpaulin
            and bamboo. After the hospital where Tracy and Yori initially worked
            was bombed twice, the wise decision was made to abandon it for a
            hidden location in the jungle.
          </p>

          <p>
            Clean Yangon, an NGO, paid to build a new emergency ward, X-ray and
            laboratory, and rooms for recovering patients. A new ward for
            infectious diseases was being built when RFA visited recently.
            Generators provide light and power. There’s sporadic internet and
            good food in the commissary.
          </p>
          <!-- Could add an extra photo here? -->
          <p>
            All things considered, though, it’s a far rougher existence compared
            with what many of the doctors and nurses are used to. The Yangon
            they knew offered air conditioning, international cuisine and new
            opportunities for women.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Before the coup, we were [living] a very privileged life,” said Dr.
            Hazel, 27, Tracy’s older sister. “We were just going to university
            and to eat out, and we have nothing else to worry about.”
          </p>
          <p>
            There are now four rebel hospitals in Kayah, including O-1, to treat
            the wounded and the sick. Six doctors work at O-1, supported by
            seven medical students and about 30 nurses.

            each month. About 150 patients are treated in that span of time, on
            average. War-related traumas are treated for free. Most poor
            patients aren’t charged either. Patients and relatives also don’t
            pay for food in the commissary.
          </p>

          <p>
            As deputy superintendent, Yori said he makes about 150,000 kyat a
            month, or around $33, which is about enough to cover his cigarette
            habit.
          </p>

          <p>“We’re not doing this for money or fame,” he said.</p>

          <p>
            The hospital is funded almost entirely by donations. After four
            years of war, fundraising is becoming more difficult, Yori said.
            That raises the stakes for the Interim Executive Council, or IEC,
            the rebel-formed state government trying to simultaneously meet the
            needs of Kayah citizens.
          </p>

          <p>
            It’s a struggle. Only about 5% of O-1’s budget comes from the IEC.
            Yori said the council is offering to take over the hospital, but the
            doctors are insisting that it be able to cover the entire budget.
          </p>

          <p>
            “If we are to be called a state hospital, we don’t want to fundraise
            anymore,” he said.

          <hr class="subhead-divider" />
          <h4>A wounded rebel</h4>
          <p>
            When RFA visited, a small group of Karenni Nationalities Defense
            Forces fighters waited nervously by a tunnel that led to an
            operating room, buried 18-feet underground to protect against
            airstrikes. The group had weary smiles of stained teeth from chewing
            betel and red eyes due to a fraught trip from the front.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the damp operating room, Dr. Aung Ko Myint, 33, repaired what he
            could in a surgery that took about four hours with equipment from
            the old hospital and anesthesia and medicine smuggled in through
            military checkpoints. He had to amputate a part of each of his
            patient’s feet.
          </p>

          <p>
            Aung Ko Myint said he hadn’t been trained as an orthopedic surgeon,
            but he’s picked up the skills in Kayah. Two days later, the young
            soldier, who uses the name Victorio, was up and smiling, describing
            how he had been wounded.

            “The battle broke out in Khwee Htoe Lar village,” Victorio said.
            ”While transporting our injured comrade, we were attacked. Two of
            our comrades, who were riding a motorcycle, were shot dead.”
          </p>

          <p>
            The shrapnel tore through Victorio’s legs and torso. It had taken
            weeks before his battalion members could clear a road from military
            troops in order to safely transport him to O-1.
          </p>

          <p>
            Aung Ko Myint’s wife, Dr. Hnin Nu Nu Wai, 30, worked as an assistant
            surgeon at the East Yangon General Hospital before the coup but quit
            immediately after to participate in the civil disobedience movement.
          </p>

          <p>
            She was only able to come to Kayah last summer, however, because
            while treating rebels and locals in Karen state to the south, she
            was captured by military troops and charged with terrorism.
          </p>

          <p>
            Hnin Nu Nu Wai spent two weeks in interrogation centers, before she
            was eventually sentenced to three years in prison. After treating
            female prisoners and prison staff and their families, however, she
            was given amnesty after two years and three months.
          </p>

            “I have so many nightmares,” she said. “That’s our life in Myanmar.”

          <!-- OVERCOMING DISTRUST -->
          <hr class="subhead-divider" />
          <h4>Overcoming distrust</h4>
          <p>
            To cope with such traumas, the O-1 team say they rely on one
            another, commiserating over being separated from loved ones, the
            stresses of war and, not surprising for a group of young, ambitious
            people, nagging disappointment at watching the career advancement of
            former colleagues who stayed behind in military controlled areas.
          </p>

          <p>
            “Now they are taking specialty courses, and meanwhile, we are in the
            jungle doing as much as we can,” said Arkar, a medical student
            training to be an orthopedic surgeon. “Everyone has their own
            choice. I don’t want to blame them. But for me, as a dutiful
            civilian, we should do the civilian disobedience movement.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond the difficulties presented by the war and limited resources,
            the doctors said initially they faced widespread distrust from the
            local population, many of whom practice Christianity instead of
            Buddhism.
          </p>

          <p>
            Yori estimated that 90% of the doctors now working in the state are
            of Burmese origin, while Kayah state is a mix of ethnic groups
            collectively considered “Karenni.” They were naturally suspicious,
            associating the new arrivals with the military, also dominated by
            Burmese, that they have long suffered under.

            As a gay man, Arkar, 26, said he feels particularly isolated at
            times. “Here it is very strict about that,” he said. “They never see
            two guys together in public.”
          </p>

          <p>
            The lack of a social scene can compound his mental health struggles
            – he suffers from anxiety and bipolar disorders – as does being
            separated from his parents. He has access to a therapist, who
            recommended he write journals to help him deal with his new
            circumstances. In his small room a short walk to the hospital campus
            there is a stack of notebooks filled cover to cover with text and
            drawings beside his bed.

            Despite it all, he’s here – “free and happy,” he says, to be serving
            the citizens and soldiers of Kayah.

          <p>
            “We are suffering so many injustices and painful moments, and so I
            guess that I should fight back for our country,” he said.

          <!-- A BIRTHDAY PARTY -->
          <hr class="subhead-divider" />
          <h4>A birthday party</h4>
          <p>
            On a cool, wet night when RFA visited the staff gathered after hours
            to celebrate Dr. Hnin’s 30th birthday.
          </p>

          <p>
            Doctors from other hospitals visited, as did medics at O-1 for
            training. Everyone swapped stories over river prawns, quail eggs and
            beef strips cooked over a small charcoal grill.
          </p>

          <p>
            They kept the lights off so as not to attract attention from drones
            or planes overhead. Junta pilots can’t hear singing, however, so
            someone brought a karaoke machine for later when the case of beer
            grew more depleted.
          </p>

          <p>
            Speaking to RFA, Dr. Tracy often punctuated a thought with a final
            “that’s all,” as in, “I decided to go to the liberated area to do
            what I can. That’s all.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Though it may be a quirk of translating a thought into a language
            not native to her, it also seemed to reflect an unsentimental
            outlook, a straightforward faith that her decision to leave Yangon
            was the right one. Those qualities are shared by her colleagues,
            including her sister.
          </p>

          <p>
            “Yes, there are slight difficulties comparing to my original
            lifestyle,” Hazel told RFA.
          </p>

          <p>
            “I don’t think of things as sacrifices or something like that. They
            are my choices. I can participate in this revolution, and I can
            contribute something – maybe just a little – to my community or
            society.
          </p>

          <p>“I’m really grateful for that.”</p>
