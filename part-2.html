            “Before, civilians didn’t trust the police, so they didn’t come to
            see us,” says Bel Kyaw May, 29, the commander of Station 8 who, like
            a chaperone, patiently watches over his officers from the side of
            the road. “We’re more friendly.”
          </p>

          <p>
            The KSP was established in August 2021, six months into a civil war
            triggered by the Myanmar military coup.
          </p>

          <p>
            The importance of developing a rebel-backed police force in the
            midst of this ongoing conflict may not be immediately clear. But
            rebels and outside observers of Myanmar say that for the insurgency
            to succeed, its backers must not only beat better-armed government
            troops on the battlefield but assure a traumatized public that they
            can replace the services that have been lost in the fighting,
            including security.

            “If you don’t do that, you run the risk of losing the support of the
            population, which in the case of the Karenni movement is really
            critical,” says Jason Tower, a Bangkok-based analyst at the United
            States Institute of Peace. Karenni is a catch-all for the various
            ethnic groups in Kayah.
          </p>

          <p>“The revolution isn’t going to end tomorrow.”</p>

          <p>
            The rebel effort to rebuild the governmental institutions, they say,
            can serve as a model for federal democracy and a showcase for how
            best to avoid the mistakes of the past, which included a Myanmar
            Police Force that was often an instrument of military repression.

            In other words, quite a lot is riding on the success of Bel Kyaw May
            and his bright-eyed recruits. “Now it’s revolutionary time,” he said
            through an interpreter. “Young people are asking, what can I do for
            the state?”

            The challenges facing the rebels in general and the KSP in
            particular, however, are considerable. The biggest is a lack of

            Insurgent leaders have created a nominal state government called the
            Interim Executive Council that raises revenue through fundraising,
            taxes and business levies.
          </p>

          <p>
            But 70% of what it collects goes to warfighting, with the remainder
            split among the KSP and health, education, humanitarian and other
            agencies in Kayah established by the council. That means that the
            KSP must try to deal with rising drug use and violence –
            consequences of the traumas of four years of war – on a shoestring
            budget.

            Bo Bo, the KSP’s chief spokesman, said the monthly allotments are
            only about 10% of what his force needs. There were 638 officers in
            the force as of August – 558 of whom were men and 180 of whom were
            women. Bo Bo estimates a few hundred more officers are still needed.
          </p>

          <p>
            The van that ferried the officers to the checkpoint is a 1996 Toyota
            Granvia that would have a hard time chasing down a scooter. There
            are more cops than guns and so few uniforms, most days officers stay
            in civilian clothes.
          </p>

          <p>
            They also aren’t regularly paid. Most live at the stations and give
            thanks to their constituents at every meal because that’s usually
            where their food comes from.
          </p>

          <p>
            “Our effectiveness is a little lower because we don’t have much
            manpower; we don’t have much money,” Bo Bo, who leads a station in
            Mese in southern Kayah state, told RFA.

            At the heart of the force are officers like Bo Bo and Bel Kyaw May,
            both of whom were members of the Myanmar Police Force but resigned
            after the coup to join a countrywide worker strike known as the
            Civil Disobedience Movement, or CDM, to pressure the junta to back
            down. More than 100 former MSP officers are now with the KSP.
          </p>

          <p>
            In earlier decades, the police force had been accused of harsh
            tactics, but, according to Tower, it had begun to reform after a
            previous military dictatorship agreed to share power in 2011.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the post-coup crackdown, bad habits resurfaced, as Myanmar Police
            Force officers busted up rallies and arrested protesters. But the
            coup also highlighted the fact that a number of officers, like Bo Bo
            and Bel Kyaw May, were more reform-minded.
          </p>

          <p>
            Shy and soft-spoken, Bo Bo said he had dreamed of being a scientist
            growing up but had gone to the police academy because it was free
            and offered steady employment after graduation. He was first
            assigned to a station in his home township but was soon transferred
            farther away because the military didn’t want its officers to have
            ties to local communities, he said.

            Officers could be roused to work on serious offenses like murder or

            The success of the insurgents on the battlefield has given them a

            they serve, the USIP’s Tower said.

          <h4>Developing habits</h4>

          <p>
            Part of what fueled corruption in the Myanmar Police Force was the
            low-pay of the officers. KSP officers make even less. They often go
            weeks without pay. As a hedge against the type of graft that plagued
            the old force sprouting in the new one, recruits must complete
            courses that include instruction not only on police procedure but
            also on Karenni history and the principles of democracy and human
            rights that underlie the revolution here.
          </p>

          <p>
            And in the Kayah rebel government organizational chart, the KSP sits
            under civilian control, unlike the Myanmar State Police, which was
            overseen by the military.

            Still, there appeared to be a few hiccups in the operation when RFA
            visited. One detainee at Station 8 was being held with one ankle
            bound in an old fashioned British stockade, a holdover from colonial
            days. “Sunday” turned out to be a member of the police force. His
            crime? He said he’d be gone for one week but took two instead.
          </p>

          <p>
            Other detainees at the two stations RFA visited were teens who had
            been caught by their parents using drugs. Fearing they were losing
            control of their children, they had asked the KSP to put them in
            jail as a form of rehabilitation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Criminal suspects, meanwhile, can sit in jail for weeks without
            having their cases adjudicated because there are so few judges and
            attorneys in Kayah.

          <h4>A dangerous job</h4>

          <p>
            The other challenge the young officers of the KSP face are the not
            insignificant dangers of their jobs.
          </p>

          <p>
            Station 8 is located off the main road among terraced hills of
            yellow-green stalks of rice swaying in the wind. The picturesque
            setting, the youthful attractiveness of the officers, and the fact
            that they live at the station gives it a summer-camp vibe.
          </p>

          <p>
            But the risks are real, and the main benefit of Station 8’s setting
            is that it’s hidden. The military junta would likely bomb the
            station if it knew where it was. Station 2 to the south was bombed
            on Sept. 5, 2024. Among the injured was Zin Zin Aung, the wife of a
            KSP officer. Her five-month-old fetus didn’t survive the attack.
          </p>

          <p>
            KSP officers are also outgunned by local drug dealers, some of whom
            have ties to ethnic armies in the area.
